<h2>Work Distrubution</h2>

<h2>Strategy</h2>

<h2>Problems</h2>
<li>We had difficulties with ports </li>
<li>We could not deploy our chat app onto heroku. </li>

<h2>Improvements</h2>
<li>A better grasp of heroku was needed </li>
<li>Not to use a peer to peer network. </li>
<li>Use more of the lessons from class </li>

# commands if users are unable to connect on heroku

```bash
npm install
npm install -g bower
bower install
node index.js

```
